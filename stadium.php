radition is such an important part of the Browns, so it's important to note that ever since they were born in 1946, they have played on the same site on the shores of Lake Erie. From 1946-95, their home was Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The Browns won all eight of their league championships there and hosted 17 postseason games. It is also where 16 men -- 15 players and one coach - built careers that eventually landed them in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.

On that same footprint is FirstEnergy Stadium, Home of the Cleveland Browns, which was opened in 1999. To keep that tradition going, the playing field at FirstEnergy Stadium runs east to west, just like it did before, and the Dawg Pound can still be found on the east side of the stadium.
But that tradition has been tweaked and enhanced with a myriad of modern amenities and conveniences that give FirstEnergy Stadium the look and feel of a 21st century facility. It fits right in with its modern neighbors, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Great Lakes Science Center.

Architectural gaps in the seating bowl at FirstEnergy Stadium at the Southeast and Southwest entrance plazas allow visitors to view the field and the inside of the facility even when the Browns aren't playing. These gaps and the upper level bridges connecting the sideline and end zone seating also allow ticket holders to see the downtown skyline.

In addition, lighting has been specially designed to highlight the columns and beams supporting the upper deck topped by a halo of light glowing from the sideline canopies.

Day or night, game day or not, FirstEnergy Stadium adds excitement and beauty to a city and fan base looking forward while at the same time honoring the past.
